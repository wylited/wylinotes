# Heart
The circulatory system is made up of blood vessels that carry blood away from and towards the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart and veins carry blood back to the heart.

## The Heart.
The heart has four chambers â€” two on top and two on bottom.
The bottom ones are ventricles, the top ones are atriums.
- The **tricuspid valve** separates the right atrium from the right ventricle.
- The **mitral valve** separates the left atrium from the left ventricle.
- The **pulmonic valve** is between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, which carries blood to the lungs.
- The **aortic valve** is between the left ventricle and the aorta, which carries blood to the body.

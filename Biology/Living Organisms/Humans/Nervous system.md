# The Human Nervous system.
There are 2 parts to the Nervous system, namely the Peripheral nervous system and the Central nervous system.

## Central nervous system.
This is the brain and the spinal cord. Coming off of the spinal cord and brains are the nerves that go into the peripheral nervous. The brain does the majority of the coordinating however the spinal cord can also coordinate a bit.

## Peripheral nervous system.
The nerves in the peripheral nervous systems go to sense organs. Like the eye, skin, tounge, ears and more.
41 nerves total, 13 from the 

## The Brain
The brain can be split into 3 major parts. The **Cerebrum**, **Brain stem**, **Cerebellum**. The Cerebrum can also be split into 2 more parts and then another 4. First the left and right hemisphere. These hemispheres can be split into 4 lobes, frontal, temporal, occipital, parietal lobe.

## Neurons
There are three types of Neurons.
Sensory Neurons, These are activated by input from the environment.
Efferent Neurons, These are neurons that cause an output environment.
Interneuron,

The Eye is a <ins>complex organ</ins>.

## Structure
### Sclera: 
The outermost layer, usually white. 3 pairs of muscles are attached to it (6 in total) that control where the eye is looking at.

### Choroid:
Inner layer between retina and sclera that has all the blood vessels.

### Retina:
This holds all the sensory parts of the eyes. Cones are sensitive to dim light changes, it can detect black and white. Rods are sensitive to bright light changes and it detects color change.

### Cornea: 
A clear layer over the pupil and iris to allow light to pass through while still protecting it.

### Forea:
The focal point of the back of the eye, usually alligned to the horizontal axis.

### Optic Nerves:
These nerves take back the information recorded by the rods and cones in the retina to the visual cortex part of the brain, this is then processed and turned into an image.

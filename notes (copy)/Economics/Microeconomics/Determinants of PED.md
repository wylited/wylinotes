## Substitutes

If consumers can substitute the good for other readily available goods, then the price elasticity of demand would be considered to be elastic. If consumers are unable to substitute a good, the good would have an inelastic demand.

---

## Necessity

The higher the necessity of a good the more inelastic it is.

---

## Time Elapsed Since a Change in Price

In the long term, consumers are more elastic over longer periods, as over the long term after a price increase of a good, they will find acceptable and less costly substitutes.

---

## Proportion of Income

A high price to income ratio would cause a product to have an elastic PED.

A low price to income ratio would make a product considered as inelastic.

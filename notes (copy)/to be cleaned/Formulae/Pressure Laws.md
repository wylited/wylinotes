# Boyle's Law

## $P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2$

| Variable | Description      | Unit     | Type   |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------ |
| $$P_1$$  | initial pressure | pressure | scalar |
| $$P_2$$  | final pressure   | pressure | scalar |
| $$V_2$$  | initial volume   | volume   | scalar |
| $$V_2$$  | final volume     | volume   | scalar | 

### Extra notes:
This law represents the inverse relationship between pressure and volume, **if** and only **if** temperature remains constant.

# Pressure Law

## $\frac {P_1}{T_1} = \frac {P_2}{T_2}$

## Where:

| Variable | Description         | Unit     | Type   |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| $$P_1$$  | initial pressure    | pressure | scalar |
| $$P_2$$  | final pressure      | pressure | scalar |
| $$V_2$$  | initial temperature | kelvin   | scalar |
| $$V_2$$  | final temperature   | kelvin   | scalar |

### Extra notes:
This law represents the proportional relationship between pressure and temperature, **if** and only **if** volume remains constant.

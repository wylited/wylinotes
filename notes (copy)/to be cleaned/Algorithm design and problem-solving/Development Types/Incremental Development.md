Method of building products piece by piece. **Stages** of the project.

The system isn't usable and therefore untestable in a whole until the whole development is complete.

New parts of the system are built one after another, and it is developed modularly. This allows for easier upgrades to the total system and makes it easier to detect bugs and fix them.

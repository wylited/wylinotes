[IGCSE Edexcel Biology (9-1) Specification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q_9cIvfuWM5FQ3Y7YQlx5tsOUftinNtC/view "Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Biology (4BI1)")

## Topic 1, The nature and variety of living organisms

- **(a)** Characteristics of living organisms
    - 1.1 understand how living organisms share the following characteristics:
		- They require nutrition
		- They respire
		- They excrete waste
		- They respond to their surroundings
		- They move
		- They control internal conditions
		- They reproduce
		- They grow and develop

- **(b)** Variety of living organisms

	- **1.2** describe the common features shown by eukaryotic organisms: plants, animals, fungi and protoctists

		- **Plants:** these are multicellular organisms; their cells contain chloroplasts and are able to carry out photosynthesis; their cells have cellulose cell walls; they store carbohydrates as starch or sucrose. Examples include flowering plants, such as a cereal *(for example, maize)*, and a herbaceous legume *(for example, peas or beans)*.

		- **Animals**: these are multicellular organisms; their cells do not contain chloroplasts and are not able to carry out photosynthesis; they have no cell walls; they usually have nervous co-ordination and are able to move from one place to another; they often store carbohydrate as glycogen. Examples include mammals *(for example, humans)* and insects *(for example, housefly and mosquito)*.

		- **Protoctists**: these are microscopic single-celled organisms. Some, like *Amoeba*, that live in pond water, have features like an animal cell, while others, like *Chlorella*, have chloroplasts and are more like plants. A pathogenic example is *Plasmodium*, responsible for causing malaria.

	- **1.3** describe the common features shown by prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria
		- **Bacteria**: these are microscopic single-celled organisms; they have a cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm and plasmids; they lack a nucleus but contain a circular chromosome of DNA; some bacteria can carry out photosynthesis but most feed off other living or dead organisms. Examples include *Lactobacillus bulgaricus*, a rod-shaped bacterium used in the production of yoghurt from milk, and *Pneumococcus*, a spherical bacterium that acts as the pathogen causing pneumonia.
		- 
	- **1.4** understand the term pathogen and know that pathogens may include fungi, bacteria, protoctists or viruses.
		- **Viruses**: these are not living organisms. They are small particles, smaller than bacteria; they are parasitic and can reproduce only inside living cells; they infect every type of living organism. They have a wide variety of shapes and sizes; they have no cellular structure but have a protein coat and contain one type of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA. Examples include the *tobacco mosaic virus* that causes discolouring of the leaves of tobacco plants by preventing the formation of chloroplasts, the *influenza virus* that causes ‘flu’ and the *HIV virus* that causes AIDS.

## Topic 2, Structure and functions in living organisms

- **(a)** Level of organization
	- 2.1 describe the levels of organization in organisms: organelles, cells, tissues, organs and systems.

- **(b)** Cell structure
	- 2.2 describe cell structures, including the *nucleus*, *cytoplasm*, *cell membrane*, *cell wall*, *mitochondria*, *chloroplasts*, *ribosomes* and *vacuole*
	- 2.3 describe the functions of the nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, cell wall, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuole
	- 2.4 know the similarities and differences in the structure of plant and animal cells
	- **2.5B** explain the importance of cell differentiation in the development of specialised cells. (TRIPLE)
	- **2.6B** understand the advantages and disadvantages of using stem cells in medicine. (TRIPLE)

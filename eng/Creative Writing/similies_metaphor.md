# English Notes

## Metaphors and Similies

### **Metaphor** | **Similies**.

- (M) Stronger but leaves room for the reader to understand themselves.
- (S) More direct towards the reader and easier to write.

### Examples.

- The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas  **✓** _Here you want to use a metaphor to guide the reader rather then tell them_

- The moon was like a ghostly galleon tossed upon clouds that were like seas. **☒** _This similie gives too much information to the reader and overwhelms_

## Pitfalls of Comparisons.

### They can become out of date and inappropriate.

- _"I mounted minto the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk."_ - Nowadays this wouldn't be alright to use.

### They convey meaning beyond just the literal and you need to consider how they make the reader feel.

- _"Eyes are white as bone"_ - Not only does this convey the imagery of the color white, this also conveys the death and horror from the word bones, this does not convey exactly what you would want.

### They can be misinterpreted or pull the reader out of their suspension of disbelief if done poorly.

- If you do a bad comparision it will stump the reader and pull them out of their imagination and confuse them, this makes your work less interesting.

## Writing a similie or metaphor.

- ### A looming gray figure cut through the clouds and with a snow cap holding it

- ### A stamepede of childrens legs flurried like a group of bulls in a race.

- ### Ash covered the sky like a blanket falling overhead blocking out the light.

- ### I smashed the breaks on the car, A small group of fuzzy yellow circles walking across the street had caught my attention.

- ### Shimmering light struck my eye as the sun refracted off of the shiny translucent surface of the costly jewellery.

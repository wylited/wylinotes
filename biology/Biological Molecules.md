# Biological molecules

The main biological molecules are made out of 5 elements

---

### Carbohydrates: Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen

This should be obvious, its in the name.

### Lipids (Fats and Oils): Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen.

Same as Carbohydrates but a different structure

### Proteins: Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Sulfur.

The amino acids in proteins use these elements to make proteins.

## Structure

### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates which are **Starch** and **Glycogen** are made up of simple sugars.
These simple sugars are Glucose (Monosaccrihide) and Maltose (Disaccharide).

### Lipids

Lipids have different names depending on their state at room temperature. Solids - Fats, Liquids - Oils.
They are made up of triglycerides, which are 1 glycerol and 3 fatty acid chains.
(Phospholipids are another type of lipids with 1 glycerol and 2 fatty acid chains).

### Proteins

Proteins are made up of several amino acids.
In total there are 27 amino acids. And as stated above they are made up Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Sulfur.

## Food Tests

| - | Carbohydrates | Starch | Protein | Lipids |
|---|----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Reagent | Benedict solution |  Iodine| Biuret | Ethanol |
| Method | Add Benedictâ€™s solution to the food and boil in a water bath | Add iodine reagent to the food. | Add Biuret reagent to the food. | Add ethanol to the food to dissolve the fat then add water. |
| Initial Color | Blue | Brick Red | Blue| Colorless| 
| Positive Indicator | Brick Red (slight precipate) | Blue-Black | Lilac / Purple| Emulsion / Whiteish clouds |

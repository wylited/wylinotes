# Movement of Substances
3 Main methods are used transport substances in a human body.

## Diffusion
Diffusion is the net movement of particles in a fluid (Gas or Liquid) over a high concentration gradient, from a high concentration to a low concentration.

### Relationships:
- Distance 1/∝ rate of movement
- Temperature ∝ rate of movement
- Concentration gradient ∝ rate of movement
- Surface to Volume ratio ∝ rate of movement

___

## Osmosis
Osmosis is also the net movements of particles in water over a high concentration gradient, from a high concentration to a low concentration.
The 2 major differences from diffusion are that it happens in water and it can go through a semi permeable membrane.

### Relationships:
- Distance 1/∝ rate of movement
- Temperature ∝ rate of movement
- Concentration gradient ∝ rate of movement
- Surface to Volume ratio ∝ rate of movement

___

## Active transport
Active transport makes use of ATP to move substances against a concentration gradient from a low concentration to a high concentration.
The ATP provides active transport with the energy required.

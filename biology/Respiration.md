# Respiration
Respiration is the process of creating energy in Animals and Plants.

## Aerobic Respiration
Aerobic Respiration uses oxygen to turn glucose into energy.

Glucose + Oxygen -> ATP + Carbon Dioxide + Water

C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + O<sub>6</sub> -> ATP + 6CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O

## Anaerboic Respiration
This is respiration without the use of oxygen to turn glucose into energy.

Glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) -> ATP + Lactic Acid (Ethanol in plants)

Anaerboic respiration has 2 major downsides. The lactic acid produced is toxic due to its high acidity and creates an increase in a oxygen debt, a temporary oxygen shortage in the body tissues arising from exercise.

## ATP and ADP
ATP - Adenosine Triphosphate (extra phosphate bond energy)
ADP - Adenosine Diphosphate (no extra phosphate bond energy)
![[ADP - ATP]]

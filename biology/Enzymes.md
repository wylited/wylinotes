# Enzymes

Enzymes are biological **catalysts** that  speed up **metabolic** reactions in our body.
Enzymes are made up of amino acids.

## Metabolic reactions

These are reactions that happen in our bodies, there are 3 main parts to it.

- The substrate.
- The product.
- The enzymes.

The substrate fits into the active site of an enzyme, it reacts and breaks or joins up into the product and gets released. The enzyme speeds up the reaction but temperature and rate of collisions can also affect it.
___

## Induced fit.

One of the key theories surrounding enzymes is about induced fit, this is how the substrate fits into the active site of the enzyme.
![[Active Site diagram]]
When the active site denatures, this reduces the efficiency of the enzyme. This is due to the induced fit, its harder for the substrate to fit into it but it still can it just takes longer.
___

## pH

pH affects the enzymes active site. At **optimum** pH the enzymes work most efficiently. 
Usually the pH of where the enzyme works is its optimum pH, a non optimum pH causes the active site to denature and therefore reduce the efficiency.

___

## Temperature

**Optimum** temperature is again the same as where the enzyme usually works. Optimum temperature where the enzyme works the most efficiently. 
Lower temperatures usually reduces the efficiency, this is because the rate of collisions is lowered with the lower kinetic energy.
Higher temperatures also reduces the efficiency, this is because it denatures the active site.

# Collection of Formulas in Physics.

## Kinetic Energy
#Kinetic_Energy #KE #Energy
$$ KE = \frac {mv^2}{2} $$
- Where:
	- Mass is in KG 
	- Velocity is in meters/second
	- Kinetic Energy is in Joules

- Rearrangements:
	- Solve for velocity $$ m = \frac {2KE}{v^2} $$ 
	- Solve for mass $$ v = \sqrt \frac {KE}{\frac {m} {2}} $$ 

## GPE (Gravitational Potential energy)
#Gravitational_Potential_Energy #GPE #Energy
$$ GPE = mgh $$
- Where:
	- Mass (m) is in KG
	- Gravity (g) is in meters / seconds 
	- Height (h) is in meters 

- Rearrangements:
	- Solve for mass $$ m = \frac {gh}{GPE} $$
	- Solve for height $$ h = \frac {mg}{GPE} $$
	- Solve for gravity $$ g = \frac {mh}{GPE} $$

## Work Done
#Work_Done is defined as the multiplication of magnitude of displacement d and the component of the force that is in the direction of displacement.
$$ Work = FD $$
- Where:
	- Work is given in Joules, 1 Joule is a newton of force through a displacement of a metre.
	- Force, given in newtons.
	- Distance, given in meters.
- Rearrangements:
	- This is simple, do I really need to tell you.

## Density
#Density
$$ ρ = d = \frac {m}{V} $$
- Where:
	- ρ or d is density, commonly given in grams per cubic centimetre.
	- m is mass, given in grams.
	- V is volume, given in cubic centimetres.
- Rearrangements:
	- Solve for mass, $$ m = ρV $$
	- Solve for volume, $$ V = \frac {m}{ρ} $$

# The nature and variety of living organisms

## Characteristics

All living organisms have the following characteristics:
-   They require nutrition
-   They respire
-   They excrete waste
-   They respond to their surroundings
-   They move
-   They control internal conditions
-   They reproduce
-   They grow and develop

## Variety

Organisms are usually split in 2 ways, their nucleus or if they are multi-cellular or not.
Prokaryotic organisms are organisms that do not have a distinct nucleus in their cells and other organelles.
Eukaryotic organisms are organisms that have a distinct nucleus in their cells.

Common eukaryotic organisms and their features:
- **Plants**: 
	- Multicellular organisms
	- Their cells have *chloroplasts* and can carry out *photosynthesis*
	- They have cellulose cell walls
	- Store carbohydrates as starch and sucrose
	- Examples: flowering plants like cereal *(maize)*, and a herbaceous legume *(peas or beans)*

- **Animals**:
	- Multicellular organisms
	- Instead of cell walls, they have cell membranes
	- Nervous co-ordination and the ability to move
	- Stores carbohydrates as glycogen

- **Protoctists**:
	- Single celled organisms.
	- Some, like *Amoeba*, that live in pond water, have features like an animal cell
	- Others, like *Chlorella*, have chloroplasts and are more like plants
	- A pathogenic example is *Plasmodium*, responsible for causing malaria

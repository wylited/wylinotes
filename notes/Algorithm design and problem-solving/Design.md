The design cycle is composed of 4 major sections:

- Decomposition,
- Structure diagrams, 
- Flowcharts, 
- Pseudocode

## Decomposition

We need to break down the **problem** and **requirements** into smaller parts which allow us to solve them using a computer.

Example component parts are: 
- Input
- Processes
- Outputs
- Storage

Structure diagrams are a visual representation of the broken down storage.

## Structure Diagrams

Structure Diagrams show us different actions or components that the project will require.

## Flowcharts 

Flowcharts are a method as which algorithms and processes are shown graphically.

## Pseudocode

Pseudocode is an easier to understand flow of code which isn't meant to be compiled.

This pseudocode mixes a programming language and english to make it easier to understand.

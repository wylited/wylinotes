Velocity graphs are graphs that have:
- Velocity as the Y axis.
- Time as the X axis. 

The area under the curve of a velocity graph is the total displacement of the object.

The gradient of the line can determine the change of velocity for a moving object.

| Gradient | Meaning |
| ----------|-----------|
| x > 0  | The object is moving, increase in velocity. |
| x = 0 | The object is not moving, no change velocity. |
| x < 0 | The object is moving, decrease in velocity |

The steeper the gradient, the higher the velocity change.

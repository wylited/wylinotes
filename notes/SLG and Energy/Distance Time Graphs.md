Distance Time graphs are graphs that have:
- Distance as the Y axis.
- Time as the X axis. 

The gradient of the line can determine the current velocity of a moving object.

| Gradient | Meaning |
| ----------|-----------|
| x > 0  | The object is moving, positive velocity. |
| x = 0 | The object is not moving, 0 velocity. |
| x < 0 | The object is moving, negative velocity |

The steeper the gradient, the higher the velocity.

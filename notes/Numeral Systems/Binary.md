Binary is a numeral system. It only has 2 different values, 1 and 0. It uses base 2.

Each place value in a binary number is 2<sup>n</sup> where n is the place (decimal).

| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| -- | -- | - | - | - | - |
| 1  | 0  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

Would be 32 + 4 + 1 which is 37 in decimal.

Binary is majorly used with data in Computer Science. This is due to the fact that CPU's have transistors and these transistors have 2 states, on or off. This works very well with binary as binary values are either 0 or 1.

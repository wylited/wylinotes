Octal is the least used out of the 4 major [[Numeral Systems]]. Octal uses base 8, from 0 - 7.

Each place value in a binary number is 8<sup>n</sup> where n is the place (decimal).

| 32768 | 4096 | 512 | 64 | 8 (8^1) | 1 (8^0) |
| ----- | ---- | --- | -- | ------- | ------- |
| 0     | 2    | 0   | 1  | 5       | 7       |

The value 020157 is (2 * 4096) + (1 * 64) + (5 * 8) + (7 * 1) = 8303 in decimal

The Octal Number system is widely used in computer application sectors and digital numbering systems. The computing systems use 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit word which is further divided into 8-bits words. The octal number is also used in the aviation sector in the form of a code.

Conversion in Binary, Hexadecimal and Octal is relatively easy due to them all being able to be summed up to powers of 2.

Every 3 place values of a Binary number can be easily converted into its correspondent octal place value.

Example: 111111 -> breaks down into 111 and 111 -> 111 is 7 in octal -> so 111 111 is 7 7 in octal.

This also works for [[Hexadecimal]].

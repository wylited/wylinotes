## [[1 - Biology#The nature and variety of living organisms]]

### **(a)** [[1 - Biology#Characteristics]] of living organisms
- 1.1 understand how living organisms share the following characteristics:
	- They require nutrition
	- They respire
	- They excrete waste
	- They respond to their surroundings
	- They move
	- They control internal conditions
	- They reproduce
	- They grow and develop

### **(b)** [[1 - Biology#Variety]] of living organisms

- **1.2** describe the common features shown by eukaryotic organisms: plants, animals, fungi and protoctists

	- **Plants:** these are multicellular organisms; their cells contain chloroplasts and are able to carry out photosynthesis; their cells have cellulose cell walls; they store carbohydrates as starch or sucrose. Examples include flowering plants, such as a cereal *(for example, maize)*, and a herbaceous legume *(for example, peas or beans)*.

	- **Animals**: these are multicellular organisms; their cells do not contain chloroplasts and are not able to carry out photosynthesis; they have no cell walls; they usually have nervous co-ordination and are able to move from one place to another; they often store carbohydrate as glycogen. Examples include mammals *(for example, humans)* and insects *(for example, housefly and mosquito)*.

	- **Protoctists**: these are microscopic single-celled organisms. Some, like *Amoeba*, that live in pond water, have features like an animal cell, while others, like *Chlorella*, have chloroplasts and are more like plants. A pathogenic example is *Plasmodium*, responsible for causing malaria.

- **1.3** describe the common features shown by prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria
	- **Bacteria**: these are microscopic single-celled organisms; they have a cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm and plasmids; they lack a nucleus but contain a circular chromosome of DNA; some bacteria can carry out photosynthesis but most feed off other living or dead organisms. Examples include *Lactobacillus bulgaricus*, a rod-shaped bacterium used in the production of yoghurt from milk, and *Pneumococcus*, a spherical bacterium that acts as the pathogen causing pneumonia.
	- 
- **1.4** understand the term pathogen and know that pathogens may include fungi, bacteria, protoctists or viruses.
	- **Viruses**: these are not living organisms. They are small particles, smaller than bacteria; they are parasitic and can reproduce only inside living cells; they infect every type of living organism. They have a wide variety of shapes and sizes; they have no cellular structure but have a protein coat and contain one type of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA. Examples include the *tobacco mosaic virus* that causes discolouring of the leaves of tobacco plants by preventing the formation of chloroplasts, the *influenza virus* that causes ‘flu’ and the *HIV virus* that causes AIDS.

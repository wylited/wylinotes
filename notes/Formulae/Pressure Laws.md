# Boyle's Law

## $P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2$

## Where:

- $P_1$ is initial pressure, given in a unit of pressure (Scalar or Vector)
- $P_2$ is final pressure, given in bar. (Scalar or Vector)
- $V_1$ is initial volume, given in an unit of volume. (Scalar or Vector)
- $V_2$ is final volume, given in an unit of volume that is the same as $V_1$'s unit.

## Extra notes:

- This law represents the inverse relationship between pressure and volume, **if** and only **if** temperature remains constant.

# Pressure Law

## $\frac {P_1}{T_1} = \frac {P_2}{T_2}$

## Where:

- $P_1$ is initial pressure, given in an unit of pressure. (Scalar)
- $P_2$ is final pressure, given in an unit of pressure. (Scalar)
- $V_1$ is initial temperature,, given in Kelvin. (Scalar)
- $V_2$ is initial temperature,, given in Kelvin. (Scalar)

## Extra notes:

- This law represents the proportional relationship between pressure and temperature, **if** and only **if** volume remains constant.

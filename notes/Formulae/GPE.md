# GPE (Gravitational Potential Energy)

## $GPE = m⋅g⋅h$

## Where:

- m is mass, given in kilogram
- g is the Gravitational acceleration, given in ms<sup>1</sup>
- h is the height, given in metres

## Rearrangements:

- Solve for mass $m = \frac {g⋅h}{GPE}$
- Solve for height $h = \frac {m⋅g}{GPE}$
- Solve for gravity $g = \frac {m⋅h}{GPE}$

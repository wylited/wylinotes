# Work Done

## $w = F ⋅ s ⋅ cos(Θ)$

## Where:

- $W$ is work, given in Joules. (Scalar)
- $F$ is force, given in newtons. (Vector)
- $s$ is displacement, given in meters. (Vector)
- $Θ$ is the angle between the force vector F and the displacement vector s, given in radians or degrees. (Scalar)

## Rearrangements:

- Solve for force, $F = \frac {s ⋅ cos(Θ)}{w}$
- Solve for displacement, $s = \frac {F ⋅ cos(Θ)}{w}$
- Solve for angle, $Θ = cos^-1( \frac {F ⋅ s}{w} )$

## Extra information

- Work is a scalar unit, this is because force and displacement are both vector units.
- Work done is calculated for when force and displacement are in the same direction, which is why `cos(Θ)` is required.

# Specific Heat Capacity

## $$E = m ⋅ c ⋅ ΔT$$

## Where:
- $E$ is the energy required, given in joules. (Scalar)
- $m$ is mass, given in kg. (Scalar)
- $c$ is the specific heat capacity, given in $J^-1kgK$. (Scalar)
- $ΔT$ is change in temperature, given in Kelvin. (Scalar)
	
## Rearrangements:
- Solve for mass, $m = \frac {m ⋅ c ⋅ ΔT}{E}$
- Solve for specific heat capacity, $c = \frac {m ⋅ ΔT}{E}$
- Solve for change in temperature, $ΔT = \frac {m ⋅ c}{E}$

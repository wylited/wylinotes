# Liquid Pressure

## $$  P = h ⋅ ρ ⋅ g $$

## Where:

- $P$ is liquid pressure, given in pascals. (Scalar)
- $h$ is height (depth), given in metres.
- $ρ$ is the density of the liquid ([[Fluid Density]]), given in grams per centimetres cubed.
- $g$ is gravitational force, given in m/s.

## Rearrangements:

- Solve for height,$h = \frac {ρ⋅g}{P}$
- Solve for [[Fluid Density]], $ρ = \frac {h⋅g}{P}$
- Solve for gravitational acceleration,  $g = \frac {h⋅ρ}{P}$

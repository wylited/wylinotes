# Acceleration

## $$ A = \frac {ΔV}{t} $$ (Solving for A)

## Where:
- A is acceleration, given in meters per second squared. (Vector)
- ΔV is change in velocity, given in metres per second. (Vector)
- t is time, given in seconds. (Scalar)
	
## Rearrangements:
- Solve for time, $$ t = \frac {ΔV}{A} $$
- Solve for z, $$ ΔV = A ⋅ t $$

## Extra notes
- ΔV is the same as v - u, where v is final velocity and u is initial velocity.

# Acceleration


## $A = \frac {ΔV}{t}$

| Variable | Description        | Unit                             | Type   |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------ |
| $A$      | acceleration       | difference in velocity over time | vector |
| $ΔV$     | change in velocity | distance over time               | vector |
| $t$      | time               | time                             | scalar |
| ______   |                    |                                  |        |

## Rearrangements

#### Solve for $t$ $t = \frac{ΔV}{A}$

#### Solve for $ΔV$ $ΔV = A ⋅ t$

### Extra notes

$ΔV$ is the same as $v$ - $u$, when $v$ is final velocity and $u$ is initial velocity.

# Acceleration

## $A = \frac {ΔV}{t}$

## Where:

- $A$ is acceleration, given in meters per second squared. (Vector)
- $ΔV$ is change in velocity, given in metres per second. (Vector)
- $t$ is time, given in seconds. (Scalar)

## Rearrangements:

- Solve for time,  $t = \frac {ΔV}{A}$
- Solve for change in velocity, $ΔV = A ⋅ t$

## Extra notes

- $ΔV$ is the same as $v$ - $u$, where $v$ is final velocity and $u$ is initial velocity.

# Collection of Formulae in Physics.

Physics is made up of several, several formulae. This sub-folder contains all that I have learned, for quick and easy access.

## Work Done

[[Work Done]] is defined as the multiplication of magnitude of displacement d and the component of the force that is in the direction of displacement.
$Work = FD$

- Where:
  - Work is given in Joules, 1 Joule is a newton of force through a displacement of a metre.
  - Force, given in newtons.
   - Distance, given in meters.
- Rearrangements:
  - This is simple, do I really need to tell you.

## Density

[[Density]]
$ρ = d = \frac {m}{V}$

- Where:
  - ρ or d is density, commonly given in grams per cubic centimetre.
  - m is mass, given in grams.
  - V is volume, given in cubic centimetres.
- Rearrangements:
  - Solve for mass, $m = ρV$
  - Solve for volume, $V = \frac {m}{ρ}$

## Pressure

[[Pressure]]
$P = \frac {F}{A}$

- Where:
  - P is Pressure, given in pascals
  - F is Force, given in newtons
  - A is area, given in meters<sup>2</sup>.
- Rearrangements
  - Solve for force, $F =$

## Acceleration
$A = \frac {ΔV}{S}$
- Where:
	- A is Acceleration, given in meters per second square (ms<sup>-2</sup>)
	- ΔV is change in Velocity, given in meters per second.
	- S is time, given in seconds.

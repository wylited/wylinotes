# Collection of Formulae in Physics.

Physics is made up of several, several formulae. This sub-folder contains all that I have learned, for quick and easy access.

Here is a list of them

- [[Kinetic Energy]]
- [[GPE]]
- [[Work Done]]
- [[Fluid Density]]
- [[Acceleration]]
- [[Fluid Pressure]]

## Acceleration
$A = \frac {ΔV}{S}$
- Where:
	- A is Acceleration, given in meters per second square (ms<sup>-2</sup>)
	- ΔV is change in Velocity, given in meters per second.
	- S is time, given in seconds.

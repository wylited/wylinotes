# Fluid Pressure

## $$ P = \frac {F}{A} $$ 

## Where:
- P is pressure, given in pascals. (Scalar)
- F is the force perpendicular to the wall, given in newtons. (Scalar)
- A is area, given in meters<sup>2</sup>. (Scalar)
	
## Rearrangements:
- Solve for Force, $$ F = Pâ‹…A $$
- Solve for Area, $$ A = \frac {F}{P} $$

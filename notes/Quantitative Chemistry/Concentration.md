+ Solute: A substance you dissolve in the solvent, such as salt.
+ Solvent: The liquid which the solute is dissolved into, such as water.
+ Solution: A mixture of the solvent and the solute.
+ Concentration: The ratio of solute to the total solution.

## $$ c = \frac {mol}{V} $$

## Where:
- $c$ is concentration, given in $moldm^-3$.
- $mol$ is solute moles, given in mols.
- $V$ is volume, given in $gdm^-3$.
	
## Rearrangements:
- Solve for moles, $mol = \frac cV$
- Solve for volume, $V = \frac {mol}{c}$

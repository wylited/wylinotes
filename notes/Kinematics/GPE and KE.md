# GPE and KE

Objectives:
Describe and explain GPE and KE.
Know the equations for both energy types.

## Equation for weight

Weight (N) = Mass (Kg) * Gravitational acceleration (ms<sup>-2</sup>).
Gravitational force earth is usually used as 10 ms<sup>-2</sup> or 9.8 ms<sup>-2</sup>.

## Equation for GPE, Gravitational potential energy.

GPE (Joules) = Mass (Kg) * Gravitational acceleration (ms<sup>-2</sup>) * Height (Meters)

## Equation for KE, Kinetic Energy

KE (Joules)= Mass (Kg) x Velocity (ms<sup>-2</sup>)

## Equation for Speed.

Speed (m/s) = Distance (m) / Time (s)

## Car experiment.

Measure the time it takes for a 1 kg car to travel down a 1.5 meter ramp.
Gravity = 10 m/s

| Height (M) | GPE (J) | Time (S) | Speed (ms<sup>-1</sup>) | KE (J) | Distance  (M) |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| 0.10       | 1.00    | 2.58     | 0.58                    | 0.17   | 1.50          |
| 0.20       | 2.00    | 1.66     | 0.90                    | 0.41   | 1.50          |
| 0.30       | 3.00    | 1.20     | 1.25                    | 0.78   | 1.50          |
| 0.40       | 4.00    | 1.06     | 1.42                    | 1.01   | 1.50          |
| 0.50       | 5.00    | 0.92     | 1.63                    | 1.33   | 1.50          |

**Questions:**

1. As the height increases, the GPE, speed and KE increases. The time taken is lowered.
2. With a higher height, you get a higher GPE. This GPE is transferred into KE.
3. I would expect equal values of GPE and KE.
4. To improve the accuracy, I would repeat this several times. I would also make the slope have as littlest amount of friction possible to reduce energy loss.

Work done = 7000J
His speed at the bottom
Due to KE = 7000J, mass = 70KG
therefore v = 14.1 m/s

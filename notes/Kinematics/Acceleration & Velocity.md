# Acceleration & Velocity

## <ins>Objectives</ins>

- Describe how to calculate acceleration.
- Describe scalars and vectors.

## Scalar V/S Vector quantities.

Scalar quantities have **magnitude**, only, an amount. Such as speed, mass, distance or energy.

Vector quantities have **magnitude** and **direction**. Forward and upwards tend to be positive, while backwards and downwards are negative. e.g. velocity, force, displacement, acceleration.

## Distance and Displacement

To understand speed and velocity, we must first understand distance and displacement.
Distance is the overall distance moved, while displacement is the distance moved relative to the origin point. Displacement is vector while distance is a scalar unit.

## Speed / Velocity

$s = \frac {|d|}{t}$

- Where:
  - s is speed given in meters per second (ms<sup>-1</sup>)
  - |d| is absolute change in distance, given in meters.
  - t is time, given in seconds.

- Rearrangements:
  - Solve for time, $t = \frac {|d|}{s}$
  - Solve for distance, $|d| = ts$

$V = \frac {s}{t}$

- Where:
  - V is velocity given in meters per second (ms<sup>-1</sup>)
  - s is displacement, given in meters.
  - t is time, given in seconds.

- Rearrangements:
  - Solve for time, $t = \frac {s}{V}$
  - Solve for displacement, $s = Vt$
  -

## Acceleration

$A = \frac {ΔV}{t}$

- Where:
  - A is Acceleration, given in meters per second square (ms<sup>-2</sup>)
  - ΔV is change in Velocity, given in meters per second.
  - t is time, given in seconds.

- Rearrangements:
  - Solve for change in velocity, $ΔV = \frac At$
  - Solve for time taken, $t = \frac {A}{ΔV}$

# Power

## Objectives:

Describe and Explain what is meant by power.

## Starter:

1 - Light Bulb: Electricity -> Heat, Sound, Light. Where Heat and Sound is wasted.
2 - (80/200) * 100 = 40.

## Power is force * velocity OR Work Done / Time

Power (W) = Work Done (J) / Time (S)
Work Done (J) = Force (N) / Distance (M)
[[Power]]

Power is a measure of the amount of work done used over a given time period.
Power has a unit of Watt. Energy has a unit of Joule.
Each appliance has a power rating, which is the number of Joules transferred each second.

## Example questions

1. Calculate the power of appliance transferring 50J of energy every 10 seconds.

5J

2. Calculate the work done of an appliance with a power rating of 100W being used for 10 seconds.

1000 J

3. Calculate the time a TV is on for which uses 100W and 2000J.

20 seconds.

## Other notes

1000 Watts is 1 kWatt
1 minute is 60 seconds
360 Seconds is 1 hour.

## Practical

Height of step: 13 cm
Number of steps: 13 cm
Total Height: 1.69 m
Mass of you: 55 Kg
Weight: 550 Newtons
Work Done: 550 * 1.69 = 929.5 joules
Time Taken: 2.65
Power: 929.5 / 2.65 = 350.75

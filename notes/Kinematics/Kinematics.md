# Kinematics

Kinematics is a subfield of physics that is based around the movements of points, bodies and a group of bodies.

Kinematics is made up of the mixture of these values.

```
s - Displacement.
u - Initial velocity. (also shown as v <sub>i</sub>)
v - Final velocity. (also shown as v <sub>f</sub>)
a - Acceleration
t - Time
```

20 equations revolve around these values. However, there are 5 main ones. (4 in IGCSE)

## Velocity and Speed.

The velocity of a particle is the **vector** quantity that contains the magnitude as well as direction of motion of the particle.

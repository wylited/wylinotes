## Errors

Transcription and Transposition are 2 types of errors made while transmitting and reading data.

Transposition is when the position of 2 digits are swapped.

- 692 -> 629.

Transcription is when you change a full digit to a different one.

- 766 -> 756.

A longer piece of data can cause a higher chance of data error.

## Error checking.

Computers need methods to validate data transferred and make sure that there is no errors in the transmitted data.
Those methods are:

- [[Parity bit]]
- Check digits.
- Check sums.
- Echo Checks
- Automatic Repeat reQuests.

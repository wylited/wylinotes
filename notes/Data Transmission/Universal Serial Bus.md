- [[Universal Serial Bus#USB 4 0]]

Aside from these generations, there are 3 different types of USB's that are available each of which have 3 sub types.

| Standard | Mini | Micro |
| - | -  | - |
| <ul><li>A</li><li>B</li><li>C</li></ul>| <ul><li>A</li><li>B</li><li>AB</li></ul> | <ul><li>A</li><li>B</li><li>AB</li></ul> |

## USB 1.x

### 1.0

The first release of USB, in 1996.

Which had speeds of 1.5 Mbit/s (Low) and 12 Mbit/s (Full) 

This release contained only the USB standard type A and B. Each containing 4 pins.

### 1.1

A minor release after 1.0, in 1998.

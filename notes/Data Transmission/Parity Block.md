## Parity Blocks
In a parity block, every byte has a parity bit and at the end of the byte sequence we have a parity byte. 
This parity byte uses the same philosophy as a parity bit. But, instead of going across a byte and putting an extra bit at the end, each of the column per byte of information has a parity bit for the corresponding row that is a parity bit for the whole row.

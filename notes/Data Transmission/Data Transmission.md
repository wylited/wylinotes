Data transmission is the process of sending data from one machine to another digitally.

There are 2 methods of transmission:
### [[Serial Transmission]]
### [[Parallel Transmission]]
We have to evaluate the pro's and con's of serial and the pro's and con's of parallel to understand which one should be used when.

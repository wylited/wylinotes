## <ins> Brainstorming </ins>

---

## <ins> Outline (~4 paragraphs) </ins>

- ### Each has 1 clear focus, a change in topic should be a new paragraph

- ### Avoid dialogue, or wide usage of time

### 1 - Setting

- Space (what is the area like, try to appeal to senses).
- Time (through show not tell).
- Use sound to create an atmosphere and mood, focus on bigger details to ease the reader into the story.

### 2 - People

- Narrow / More specific focus on the details of the area around you
- Don't try to create a plot, small details of whats happening is fine as long as its pulling more towards the description of whats happening.
- Try to answer Why? and Who?
- If you haven't appealed to senses do that now.

### 3 - Apply to the Prompt

- Attempt to apply to all senses.
- Higher level vocabulary, and grammar structures. Aim for longer, more complex sentences.
- For a prompt like this, make sure you mention things like what food they are eating.

### 4 - Wrap it all up

- Make sure you've done everything you need too, if you haven't do it here.
- Fill in the blanks, if you feel like you haven't done enough justice to a certain aspects, fill it in.
- Ease the reader out, attempt to go back to a bigger picture as you finish off the story.
- Final action, related to your prompt. Give the sense that the descriptive piece has been completed.

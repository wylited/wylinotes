## GAPS

1. Audience: This article is made for developers who use discord on a daily basis. They would like to see how discord is being changed and developed and therefore would read this blog.
2. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to inform the reader about the major reasoning behind switching some of the backend Go code for the discord application to rust.
3. "# Why Go did not meet our performance targets", "We want to make sure Discord feels super snappy all the time, so we need to make sure Read States is quick.", "Rust does not have garbage collection, so we figured it would not have the same latency spikes Go had."
4. The article instantly tries to start a discussion/debate over whether Rust or Go is better, this drags you into the article and gets you invested for information.
5. The article is very informative and persuasive. It uses a lot of graphs and statistics. They also use quotes from authority figures and higher level language that the reader is meant to understand.
6. To finish off, the long article has a closing subheading.

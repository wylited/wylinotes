## Economic Assumptions

Throughout Economics, there are 2 *assumptions* that are made:

1) Consumers aim to maximise benefits.
--

2) Producers aim to maximise profit.
--

## Consumers

When **maximising benefits**, Consumers look for:

- **Utility** of a good or service.
- **Satisfaction** gained from the good or service.

But, Consumers may not always get the maximum benefit due to:

- Consumers are **not the best** at calculating benefits.
- Consumers have **habits** that are hard to give up.
- Consumers **copy** other behaviours.

## Producer

**Maximising profits**:

- Inelastic products - **Increase** prices
- Elastic products - **Decrease** prices

But, Producers may not always be able to maximise their profits due to:

- The performance may be **influenced** by other people in the company.
- The producer has **other business objectives**.
- They are a **charity**.
- They are a **social enterprise**.

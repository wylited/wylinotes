Describe the difference between series and parallel circuits.

## Series

Current is always the same on a series circuit wherever you measure it. 
Ammeters are always placed in series, not parallel.

## Parallel

The circuit has a choice of routes, it has 2 or more loops in the circuit.

The current is split evenly across the branches if the components are the same.

When the branches have uneven resistances, current will take the path of least resistance.

### Advantages:
- If a branch breaks, the other branches still function.
- You can control parts and branches of the circuit.

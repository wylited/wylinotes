# Sustainability

Resource consumption has a large impact on the planet.

## Finite resources

Finite resources, also known as **non-renewable resources** with enough consumption will eventually run out.
Examples:

- Fossil fuels like coal and oil.
- Petroleum.
- Natural gases.

## Non-Finite resources

Non-Finite resources, also known as **renewable resources** are resources that if properly managed will never run out.
Examples:

- Water
- Sunlight
- Oxygen
- Carbon dioxide
- Wood

# Production
There is a high potential future use of new and emergent technologies in production.

## Computer aided design and manufacturing
Computer aided design and manufacture can speed up the design cycle and production process on a order of several magnitudes to allow for a faster and more streamlined system.
## Just in time and Lean manufacturing.
Just in time manufacturing is where you manufacture the goods as you receive the orders.
Lean manufacturing is where you manufacture the goods as you receive the materials to produce them.

## Flexible manufacturing systems.
FMS is a production method that is designed to easily adapt to changes in the product.

## Automation
Automation is the process of automated tasks that can be done without requiring human supervision.

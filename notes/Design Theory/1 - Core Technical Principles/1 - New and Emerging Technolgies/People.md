## Technology Push / Market Pull

**Technology Push**: A technology push is a new invention that is pushed through research and development, production and sales and enters onto the market, sometimes without considering whether or not it satisfies a users need.

**Market Pull**: When a market demands a product or a service type, or defines a problem.

Technology has created and removed the need for jobs in the economy.

Overall this lowers the need for "dirty" and labour intensive jobs, improving the state of humanity while creating new jobs that challenge and make use of human creativity and intelligence.

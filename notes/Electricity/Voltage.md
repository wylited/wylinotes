Voltage is the pressure from an electrical circuit's power source that pushes charged electrons (current) through a conducting loop. 

Measured in Volts (V)

Voltage is also electrical potential difference. Electrons flow faster at a higher difference in electrical potential, so a higher voltage means a higher rate of electrons.

The formula for voltage is
$$
V = \frac {J}{C}
$$
or
$$
V = \frac {E}{Q}
$$

For example, a 1.5V rating means that if 1 coulomb of charge that comes out of the battery would give off 1.5 joules of energy before it re enters the other side. 

Voltmeters are added in parallel to a circuit. To measure the voltage of a certain electrical appliance, you put the voltmeter in parallel around the appliance

In a series circuit, the total voltage for each component is equal to the voltage across the battery.
The voltage of the battery must be equal to the voltage of each of the units.

In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each branch stays the same. However on the same branch it is still split.

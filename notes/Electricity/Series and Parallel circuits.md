Describe the difference between series and parallel circuits.

## Series

Current is always the same on a series circuit wherever you measure it. 
Ammeters are always placed in series, not parallel.

## Parallel

The circuit has a choice of routes, it has 2 or more loops in the circuit.

The current is split evenly across the branches if the components are the same.

Electrical circuits make use of electricity and wires to allow energy to flow from one end to another

Electric current is the rate of flow of electric charge.

An electric current flows when electrons move through a conductor, such as a metal wire.
Electricity passes through metallic conductors as a flow of negatively charged electrons.

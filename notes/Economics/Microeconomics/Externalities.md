An externality is a cost or benefit caused by a producer that is not financially incurred or received by that producer.

An externality can be both *positive* or *negative* and can stem from either the production or consumption of a [[Goods def.|good]] or [[Services def.|service]].

It can be split into 2 categories:

- The Cost of Production:
	- [[External Costs|External costs]]
	- [[Private Costs|Private costs]]
	- Which both determine the [[Social Costs|social costs]]
- The Benefit of Consumption:
	- [[External Benefits|External benefits]]
	- [[Private Benefits|Private benefits]]
	- Which both determine the [[Social Benefits|social benefits]]

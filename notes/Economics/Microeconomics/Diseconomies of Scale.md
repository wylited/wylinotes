[[Diseconomies of Scale def.|Disceconomies of scale]] arise when the a firm continues to expand beyond a certain point average costs rises.

- Bureaucracy
  > Decision-making may be slow and too many resources used in administration (too much time spent filling forms/reports)  → average cost rises.
- Communication problems
  > When workers are employed all over the world, they speak different languages, have different cultures and operate in different time zone → communication is challenging → time causes average cost to rise.
- Lack of control
  > If the firm has thousands of employees and dozens of plants around the world, more supervision and management is required → average cost rises.
- Distance of employees
  > A firm too big may lead to bad relations between workers and managers to worker since there are many layers of management from the top to the bottom.
  > Managers may not be aware of the worker’s needs -> workers feel demotivated -> conflicts occur and resources wasted

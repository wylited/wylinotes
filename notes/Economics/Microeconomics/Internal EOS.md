Cost benefits that an **individual** firm can enjoy when it expands.

There are 6 Internal Economies of Scale:

- Purchasing EOS
  > Bulk buying – being able to buy raw materials in bulk lowers the unit price.
- Marketing EOS
  > Advertising costs can be spread.
- Technical EOS
  > More efficient use of machinery that was invested in
- Financial EOS
  > Easier for large firms to raise capital. Better lending terms and lower interest rates – easier to borrow money
- Managerial EOS
  > Large businesses can employ specialist staff. More specialised management can be employed, saves business money because they are more efficient.
- Risk Bearing EOS
  > Large firms can afford to take risks with new products / services because other parts of the businesses are still profitable.

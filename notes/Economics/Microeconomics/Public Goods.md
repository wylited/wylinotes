Public goods are [[Goods def.|goods]] produced by the [[Public Sector|public sector]].

There are 2 main **traits** of the [[Public Goods def.|public good]]:

- Non excludable,
  > Once the good is in the market any consumer cannot be excluded from consumption, therefore any consumer can benefit without paying
- Non rivalry,
  > Consumption of a product doesn't reduce the amount for others (generally speaking).

These 2 traits cause the [[The Free Rider Problem]].

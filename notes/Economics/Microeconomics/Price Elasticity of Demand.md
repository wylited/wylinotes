$$

PED = \frac{ΔqD\%}{Δp\%}

$$

(PED = Percentage change in quantity demanded over percentage change in price)

PED is always negative (due to it representing the negative gradient of the demand curve), but it is applied as if it is positive.

| Type                | Value     | Explanation                                                          |
| ------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inelastic           | 0 < x < 1 | It is more lucrative to increase the price to increase total revenue |
| Elastic             | 1 < x < ∞ | It is more lucrative to decrease the price to increase total revenue |
| Perfectly Inelastic | x = 0     | Aka fixed demand                                                     |
| Perfectly Elastic   | x = ∞     | …                                                                  |
| Unitary Elastic     | x = 1     | Total revenue doesn't change depending on price                      |

PED is can be affected by its [[Determinants of PED|determinants]].

Supply is the amount of a good that would be supplied at a given price.

> When price goes up, quantity goes up.

Supply has a proportional relationship with price. So when price shifts there is a movement along the demand curve.

However it should be noted that a profit motive is required for a company to supply a good.

there are [[Factors of Supply |5 factors that affect supply]].

$$

YED = \frac{ΔqD\%}{Δp\%}

$$

(YED = Percentage change in quantity demanded over percentage change in income)

YED is always negative (due to it representing the negative gradient of the demand curve), but it is applied as if it is positive.

| Type              | Value     | Explanation                                                          |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Normal good       | 0 < x     | It is more lucrative to increase the price to increase total revenue |
| Luxury good       | 1 < x < ∞ | It is more lucrative to decrease the price to increase total revenue |
| Inferior good     | x < 0     | Aka fixed demand                                                     |

YED is can be affected by its [[Determinants of YED|determinants]].

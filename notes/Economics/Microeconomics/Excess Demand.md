title: Excess Demand

#microeconomics #economics

Excess demand is when the price of a good is lower than the equilibrium price.

Meaning more consumers want to buy the good than the amount of goods suppliers are able to sell.

The difference between the quantity demanded (QD) and the quantity supplied (QS) is the excess demand.

#microeconomics #economics

## Workers

Constant repetition of one task causes

- Boredom
- Low motivation + they might be dissatisfied
- Might be difficult to find employment if they are too specialised (low job mobility).

## Firms

Workers will become demotivated due to boredom, so that would decrease productivity and efficiency thereby increasing cost and decreasing revenue.

- More costly (providing financial incentive scheme)
- Possibly decrease in profit â†’ cost has gone up (absent / high turnover rate)
- Easily disruptable production line

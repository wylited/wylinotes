---

#microeconomics #economics

The factors of productivity are generally the same as the [[Factors of Production|factors of production]], **apart from the fact that enterprise does not affect productivity.**

So the 3 factors are:

- Land – use of fertiliser, drainage, irrigation, reclamation

- Labour – quality of labour, including improved human capital through education and training and impact of migration

- Capital – increased quantity and technological advances.

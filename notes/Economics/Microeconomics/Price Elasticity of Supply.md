$$
PES = \frac{ΔqS\%}{Δp\%}
$$

(PES = Percentage change in quantity supplied over percentage change in price)

PES is always positive (due to it representing the positive gradient of the supply curve).

| Type                | Value     | Explanation                                                          |
| ------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inelastic           | 0 < x < 1 | It is more lucrative to increase the price to increase total revenue |
| Elastic             | 1 < x < ∞ | It is more lucrative to decrease the price to increase total revenue |
| Perfectly Inelastic | x = 0     | Aka fixed demand                                                     |
| Perfectly Elastic   | x = ∞     | ...                                                                  |
| Unitary Elastic     | x = 1     | Total revenue doesn't change depending on price                      |

PES is can be affected by its [[Determinants of PES|determinants]].

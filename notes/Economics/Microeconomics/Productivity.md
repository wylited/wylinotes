[[Productivity def.|Productivity]] is an economic measure of output per unit of input. It is the rate at which goods are produced and the amount produced in relation to the work, time, and money needed to produce them.

PRODUCTIVITY = TOTAL OUTPUT / NUMBER OF WORKERS

Firms aim to increase productivity per worker as it increases the total output.  This is so that:

- More goods can be produced for the same or lower costs.
- [[Total Costs def.|Costs]] overall can be reduced across the business
- With lowered [[Total Costs def.|costs]], [[Total Profit def.|profits]] will increase.

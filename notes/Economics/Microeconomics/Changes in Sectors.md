title: Changes in Sectors
---

#microeconomics #economics

Sectors of the [[Economy def.|economy]] are usually represented in pie charts (to implement).

As the [[Economy def.|economy]] grows there are certain trends in the sectors:

- The [[Primary Sector def.|primary sector]] shrinks
- The [[Secondary Sector def.|secondary sector]] also shrinks but not as much as the primary
- The [[Tertiary Sector def.|tertiary sector]] grows by a lot, taking the economy size that primary and secondary sectors shrunk.

This can also represent the change between a developing -> developed country or an undeveloped -> developing -> developed.

Producers aim to maximize the revenue they produce.
However they may not achieve this for _four_ reasons:

- Performance may be influenced by other people in the company. (Managers that maximize sales instead of revenue.)
- The producer has other business objectives.
- They are a charity.
- They are a social enterprise.

(TODO!) : write notes that explain these. eg what is a charity and what is a social enterprise.

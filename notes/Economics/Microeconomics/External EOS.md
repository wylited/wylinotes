Cost benefits that **all firms** in an industry can enjoy when the industry expands.

There are 4 External Economies of Scale:

- Skilled Labour
  > Training costs lowered when workers are recruited
- Infrastructure
  > Roads, railways, ports, building and other facilities will be shaped to suit that industryâ€™s needs
- Access to suppliers
  > Since area is established, suppliers are encouraged to set up close by.
- Similar businesses in area
  > Being close to other similar businesses who can work together with each other. Having specialist supplies and support services nearby. As businesses grow within an area, specialist skills begin to develop. e.g. Silicon Valley (Palo alto)

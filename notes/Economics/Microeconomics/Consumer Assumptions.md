title: Consumer Assumptions
---

#microeconomics #economics

Consumers aim to **maximize** their **benefit**. They achieve this in _two_ ways:

- Maximizing the utility of an [[Economic Good def.|economic good]]. (Utils)
- Maximizing the satisfaction gained from the [[Economic Good def.|economic good]]. (Satisfaction)

However, consumers may not always gain the highest benefit due to _three_ reasons:

- They aren't always the best at calculating benefits.
- They can have habits that are hard to give up.
- They copy other consumers behaviors.

  (TODO!) write a note that explains utils? perhaps.

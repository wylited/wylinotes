[[Private Benefits def.]] is the [[Total Revenue def.|revenue]] a company receives from producing its goods.

If a firm achieves high profits the firm may feel they are using resources efficiently. However, societyâ€™s point of view may be different.

Private benefits are caused by the first party and only effect the first party positively.

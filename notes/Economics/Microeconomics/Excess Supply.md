title: Excess Supply

#microeconomics #economics

Excess supply occurs when the price of a good is higher than the equilibrium price.

Meaning less consumers want to buy the good than the amount of goods suppliers are able to sell.

The difference between the quantity supplied (QS) and the quantity demanded (QD) is the excess supply.

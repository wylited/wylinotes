#  The Economic Problem

Throughout economics, there is the everlasting problem of **scarcity**.
There are infinite wants but finite resources, causing people to make choices.

There are 3 main questions that revolve around this concept of **scarcity**: 
1) What will we make?
2) How to produce it?
3) Who to produce it for?

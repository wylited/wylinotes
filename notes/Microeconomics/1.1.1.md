#  The Economic Problem

Throughout economics, there is the everlasting problem of <mark style="background: #BBFABB55;">scarcity</mark>.
There are infinite wants but finite resources, causing people to make choices.

There are 3 problems that revolve around this concept of scarcity: 
1) What will we make?
2) How to produce it?
3) Who to produce it for?

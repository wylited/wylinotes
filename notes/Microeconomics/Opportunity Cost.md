## Opportunity Cost

**Opportunity cost** is the cost of switching from one alternative to the next best alternative.

## Production Possibility Curve

In Economics we have a **Production Possibility Curve** (PPC), this curve shows the different combination of 2 goods an economy can produce.

- Points under or on the curve are possible production potentials of the 2 goods.
- Points outside of the curve are unobtainable production potentials of the 2 goods.
- Points that are on the curve are the maximum production potentials of the 2 goods.

For Production Possibility, moving from one point to another is the opportunity cost.

## Production Possibility Frontier

The Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) is the curve of the PPC. This represents the maximum an economy can produce.

A shift in a PPF is a **economic growth**.
- Inwards shift is a negative economic growth.
- Outwards shift is a positive economic growth.

Economic growth is influenced by [[Factors of Productions]]

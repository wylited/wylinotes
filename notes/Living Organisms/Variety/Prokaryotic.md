Eukaryotic organisms that do not have a distinct nucleus, such as bacteria.

## Bacteria:

  - They have a cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm and plasmids.
  - They lack a nucleus, however they contain a circular chromosome of DNA.
  - Some carry out photosynthesis, but majorly they feed off of other dead or living organisms.
  - Examples:
	- _Lactobacillus bulgaricus_, a rod shaped bacterium used in the production of yogurt from milk.
	- Pneumococcus, a spherical bacterium that is a pathogen which causes pneumonia

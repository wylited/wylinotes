Prokaryotic organisms have a distinct nucleus and can further be separated into whether they are multi-cellular or single-cellular.

## Multi-Cellular

### Animals:

- Organisms that cannot make their own food by photosynthesis.
- Their [[Cells|cells]] have no walls
- They have nervous co-ordination
- They are able to move
- They store energy/carbohydrate stored as glycogen
- Examples:
  - Mammals, _(a human or flamingo)_
  - Insects, _(a housefly and mosquito)_

### Plants:

- Their cells contain chloroplasts that carry out photosynthesis.
- Their cells have walls.
- They store carbohydrates as starch or sucrose
- Examples:
  - Cereals like maize or wheat.
  - Herbaceous legume like peas and beans.

## Single-Cellular

### Protocists

- Microscopic organisms
- They have widely different characteristics and can fall into other categories like pathogens.
- Examples:
  - Amoeba, which lives in pond water and has animal cell like features.
  - Chlorella, that has chloroplasts and is more like plants
  - Plasmodium, a pathogenic example and is responsible for malaria.

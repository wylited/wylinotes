Cells are divided into 2 sub-categories, Animal and Plant.

## Parts of a Cell (Organelles)

- Cell Wall
	- A protective layer that surrounds a cell
	- Not permeable 

- Cell Membrane
	- A soft wall that wraps around and protects the cell
	- Is partially permeable / selectively permeable, allowing certain substances through

- Cytoplasm
	- A jelly like substance which is the living material of the cell

- Ribosome
	- A special organelle that uses RNA copied from DNA to produce enzymes and such from protein.

- Mitochondria
	- *The powerhouse of the cell*
	- Carries out respiration reactions for energy

- Chloroplast
	- Absorb light energy to make food in the process of *photosynthesis*
	- Contain a green pigment called chlorophyll
	- Not present in parts of the plants that aren't green

## [[Stem Cells]]

Stem Cells are the base form of all cells. These stem cells then develop into
